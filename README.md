MITOSIS is an OS support for fast remote fork---forking a container from one machine to another. 

This repo contains an overview of the whole project.

## Systems

Project Mitosis OS contains a set of different systems:

- [**Mitosis-Core**](https://github.com/ProjectMitosisOS/mitosis-core): core source code that implements the MITOSIS functionalities.

## Features

We support fast process/container fork (over 10,000 new containers from one instance in the cluster across multiple machines within a second).

We have integrated it into a serverless system, and we hope to integrate it to more systems.

## Quick Start

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/ProjectMitosisOS/mitosis-core#readme) in the [Mitosis-Core](https://github.com/ProjectMitosisOS/mitosis-core).
