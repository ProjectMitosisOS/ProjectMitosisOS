MITOSIS is an OS support for fast remote fork---forking a container from one machine to another. 

This repo contains an overview of the whole project.

## Systems

Project Mitosis OS contains a set of different systems:

- **Mitosis-Core**: core source code that implements the MITOSIS functionalities.

We will release the v0.0 on **11/20**. 

## Features

We support fast process/container fork (over 10,000 new containers from one instance in the cluster across multiple machines within a second).

We have integrated it into a serverless system, and we hope to integrate it to more systems.
